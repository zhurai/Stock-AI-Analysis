# Stock AI Analysis

Old group of scripts used to automate analysis/backtesting of stock trades in a specific format

- Analyze the logs of stock trades based off different case scenarios
- Analyze the logs and try to use it with an ETF (with a multiplier)
- Backtest the trades the AI did
- Query Yahoo to get the current chart data of a stock (not complete, might be out of date, has some old/stale cookie data from when I was testing it with requests. out of date now so it's (probably) okay
